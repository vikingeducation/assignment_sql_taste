Note: To see the schemas for these tables listed on the left panel, you need to search for "benn" where it says "Search Mode Public Tables"... they are not listed under "Tutorial" automatically like the previous tables were.

Note2: Mode uses a non-primary key "school_name" to join their tables here. You should really use primary keys wherever possible in your own data.
